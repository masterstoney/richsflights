Flight price tracking project

## Motivation
This was a project done for one my mobile development class in college. I am a huge aviation fan and I wanted to take on a project that would be able to show my skills in iOS. The project also served as a way for me to search for flight prices without the fear of the price being jacked up because of trackers used on most flight booking websites.
